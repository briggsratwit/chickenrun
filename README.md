# ChickenRun -- A Chrome Dinosaur Game Clone

ChickenRun is a clone of the Chrome Dinosaur Game intended as a beginner JavaScript game development workshop. The only required external library is `p5.js` ([link](www.p5js.org)) and the included presentation contains a step-by-step guide to complete the project.

## Getting Started  
The first few slides of the presentation describe the tools and requirements needed to create the game. A brief list here:  
* A code editor that can be used to write JavaScript
* Chrome Browser
* Web Server for Chrome app ([link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en))

Run the Web Server app (apps can be viewed by going to [chrome://apps](chrome://apps)). Select the folder where you cloned or downloaded this repository. Then, go to the address of the server created by the app: default [127.0.0.1:8887](http://127.0.0.1:8887).  

This process runs the `index.html` file that loads the starter JavaScript code. At this point, you are ready to follow along with the workshop presentation.

## File Organization
***Starter Code***  
`index.html:` Main webpage that will render the game.  
`sketch.js:` Primary JavaScript file that contains the game logic.  
`chicken.js:` Chicken class that contains parameters and methods for the player character.  
`egg.js:` Egg class that contains all the parameters and methods for the game obstacle.  
`graphics/*:` Two chicken sprites and an egg sprite for the game.  

***Completed Code***  
The files in `full/` contain the completed code for reference.
